##**Geographical Market Segmentation on Electric Vehicles Dataset.** 

1. Cleaned the dataset to address string inconsistencies, particularly in state names.
2. Merged two datasets with concurrent timelines, leveraging the state column to gain a comprehensive overview.
3. Addressed null values by replacing them with 0 or median values as appropriate.
4. Utilized three clustering techniques to identify the most suitable method, ultimately implementing K-Means clustering for segmentation.
5. Described and profiled the resulting segments, drawing actionable insights from the analysis.
