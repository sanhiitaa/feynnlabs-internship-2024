## Project Description

This project aims to create a user-friendly web application that utilizes input data to predict heart disease, recommends nearby hospitals and medications, offers personalized dietary guidance, and empowers users to make informed decisions for proactive management of heart health.


## Overview

This innovative project encompasses the development of an initial web application solely focused on predicting heart disease. Leveraging user input data, the app assesses the likelihood of heart disease, providing users with accurate predictive insights. Market segmentation strategies will identify target demographics for effective outreach. Additionally, the project includes the formulation of a robust business model and financial equation to sustainably support app development and deployment. While recommendations for nearby hospitals and medications are not yet implemented, the app's predictive capabilities lay the groundwork for future expansion into comprehensive health management. This initiative aims to address the critical need for accessible predictive tools in cardiovascular health, paving the way for proactive healthcare decisions.


## Data Sources

- **Dataset:** [Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset BRFSS 2015]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset/data)

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   Conducted EDA on the heart health indicators dataset from BRFS 2015, analyzing key variables such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors to understand their correlations with heart disease risk.

2. **Classification Model Building**:
   Employed various machine learning algorithms including neural network, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours (KNN), decision tree, and random forest to build a predictive model determining the likelihood of heart disease. Implemented a web application using Streamlit for user-friendly deployment.

3. **Market Segmentation**:
   Market segmentation was conducted across four categories—demographic, health behaviour, health status, and prevalent health condition—to tailor marketing strategies and interventions based on individual characteristics and needs.

4. **Business Model and Financial Equation**:
   Developed a comprehensive business model outlining revenue streams, cost structures, and value propositions. Utilized financial equations to project expenses, revenues, and profitability, ensuring the sustainability and viability of the project. Graphically represented the financial model for clear visualization and analysis.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project has embarked on a multifaceted approach to address the pressing issue of heart disease management, leveraging data-driven insights and innovative technologies. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, a robust classification model has been developed, laying the groundwork for accurate predictive capabilities within the initial web application. Market segmentation strategies have been employed to effectively target diverse user demographics and health profiles, ensuring tailored interventions and personalized recommendations. Additionally, the formulation of a detailed business model and financial equation underscores the project's commitment to long-term sustainability and viability. By amalgamating predictive analytics, user engagement, and strategic planning, this endeavour aims to empower individuals with timely insights and resources, ultimately contributing to proactive heart health management and improved health outcomes globally.
